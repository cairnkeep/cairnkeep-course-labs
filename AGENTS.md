# Course lab agent guide

This repository is a synthetic teaching fixture for Cairnkeep. Keep every
name, memory, credential, URL, and data record fictional. Never paste material
from a real project into a course exercise.

Run `npm test` after changing the sample application. Keep optional Cairnkeep
features disabled by default and point every lab store at `.course-state/`.

## Cairnkeep Playbooks

Use Cairnkeep's bounded playbook policy to select workflow steps. It advises or
enforces existing capabilities; it does not execute a workflow for you.

- At task start, run `cairn playbook check start --session SESSION --complexity LEVEL --familiarity LEVEL` and follow every applicable `must` action. Apply `should` actions unless there is a concrete reason to skip them; use judgment for `may` actions.
- Re-run `cairn playbook check check` when scope, familiarity, complexity, or risk changes materially.
- Before claiming completion, run `cairn playbook check finish --session SESSION --changed PATH... --risk LEVEL --public-change --completed ACTION... --skipped ACTION=REASON... --enforce` with accurate signals and evidence.
- A non-zero enforcement result means applicable `must` evidence is missing. Perform the action and check again; do not relabel a skipped or failed action as completed.
- Record material outcomes with `cairn playbook record`, using the exact policy and decision digests returned by the check. Actor identity is an unverified local assertion in this release.
- Existing approval and capability boundaries still apply. A playbook cannot enable a disabled capability, grant approval, write durable memory automatically, run arbitrary commands, or authorize destructive work.
- If the CLI or an applicable capability is unavailable, state that limitation and follow the policy intent manually; never invent a receipt or successful result.
